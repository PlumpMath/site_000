# there was some idea of an object called a card, which could be an onscreen preview, an abstract, or like a tarot card iconographic.

# they could easily also be photos. but in genneral talking thumbnail size or not full size anyway.

# they can be arranged in decks which seems to resonate with the idea of oop.  but fuck oop.
# i'm not interested in classes unless i need to be, and if it is is needed it isn't clear to me, i'm guessing
# maybe but no.  the important thing is to fulfill the --what is called in java-- the interface.  functional programs
# as compositions of functions works modularly because of the precision to which the functions are subjeected for 
# composition interface like docking.  so javascript programming is rich in interface contract specification.  echos that part 
# of java's oop which transcends its system-- java's allowance for so-called inheritance hierarchies-- .. ., multiple inheritance.

# so blah blah.  but yeah they need to be also visually similar.  deck handling is another subject but not really.  the issue
# of how cards are defined is partly informed by how decks are defined, ie, what their design imperatives were and how compromises were 
#made in implementation.



# something visual or text or audio, or web-gl routine , or animation

# cards

#  unless its text then it's just links.
